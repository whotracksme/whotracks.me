An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier, such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</span></p><p><strong><span>Profiling:</span></strong><span> Any form of automated </span><ins><span>processing</span></ins><span> of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.</span></p><p><strong><span>Services:</span></strong><span> Our offers to which this data privacy statement applies (cf.

These are small, invisible graphics in HTML emails or on websites. When a document is opened, this small image is downloaded from a server on the Internet and the download is registered there. This allows the operator of the server to see if and when an email has been opened or a website has been visited. This function is usually carried out by calling up a small program (JavaScript). Certain types of information can be detected on your computer system in this way and shared, such as the content of </span><ins><span>cookies</span></ins><span>, the time and date of the visit, and a description of the page on which the tracking pixel is located.</span></p><h3 id="2-Scope-of-validity" data-id="2-Scope-of-validity"><span>2.

Messages should be marked for the attention of the data privacy department or sent via </span><a href="mailto:privacy@ghostery.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>privacy@ghostery.com</span></a><span>.</span></p><h2 id="II-Details-of-data-processing" data-id="II-Details-of-data-processing"><span>II. Details of data processing</span></h2><h3 id="1-General-information-about-the-data-processing-operations" data-id="1-General-information-about-the-data-processing-operations"><span>1. General information about the data processing operations</span></h3><p><span>The following applies to all the processing operations listed below, unless stated otherwise:</span></p><h4 id="a-No-obligation-to-provide-personal-data-amp-consequences-of-failure-to-provide-such-data" data-id="a-No-obligation-to-provide-personal-data-amp-consequences-of-failure-to-provide-such-data"><span>a) No obligation to provide personal data &amp; consequences of failure to provide such data</span></h4><p><span>The provision of personal data is not required by law or contract, and you are under no obligation to provide any data. We will inform you during the data entry process when personal information must be provided for the relevant service (e.g. by indicating “mandatory field”). In cases where the provision of data is required, the consequence of not providing data will be that the service in question cannot be provided. Otherwise, failure to provide data may result in our inability to provide our services in the same form and quality.</span></p><h4 id="b-Consent" data-id="b-Consent"><span>b) Consent</span></h4><p><span>In various cases, you may also grant us your consent to the further processing of data (or some of the data, where applicable) in connection with the operations listed below. In this case, we will inform you separately in connection with the submission of the respective declaration of consent about all the procedures and the scope of the consent and concerning the purposes which we pursue in these processing operations. The processing operations based on your consent are therefore not listed again here (Art. 13 (4) GDPR).</span></p><h4 id="c-Transfer-of-personal-data-to-third-countries" data-id="c-Transfer-of-personal-data-to-third-countries"><span>c)	Transfer of personal data to third countries</span></h4><p><span>When we send data to third countries, i.e. countries outside of the European Union, the data are then transmitted strictly in compliance with the statutory conditions of admissibility.</span>
<span>If the transmission of the data to a third country does not serve the purpose of fulfilling our contract with you, if we do not have your consent, if the transmission is not required for asserting, exercising or defending legal claims, and if no other exemption applies under Art. 49 GDPR, we will only transmit your data to a third country if in possession of an adequacy decision pursuant to Art. 45 GDPR or appropriate guarantees under Art. 46 GDPR.</span>
<span>In order to ensure an adequate level of data protection, we provide appropriate safeguards pursuant to Art. 46 (2) c) GDPR by the conclusion of EU standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission with the receiving body. Copies of the standard EU data protection clauses are available on the website of the European Commission here.</span></p><h4 id="d-Hosting-at-external-service-providers" data-id="d-Hosting-at-external-service-providers"><span>d)	Hosting at external service providers</span></h4><p><span>Our data processing work is carried out to a large extent with the involvement of hosting service providers who provide us with storage space and processing capacities at their data centres and who also process personal data on our behalf according to our instructions. It may be the case that personal data are transmitted to hosting service providers in respect of all of the functions listed below. These service providers process data either exclusively in the EU or subject to guaranteed levels of data protection which we have put in place based on the standard EU data protection clauses (cf. subsection c).</span></p><h4 id="e-Transmission-to-government-authorities" data-id="e-Transmission-to-government-authorities"><span>e)	Transmission to government authorities</span></h4><p><span>In principle, we do not transmit any data to government authorities.</span>
<span>We only send personal information to government authorities (including law enforcement agencies) when required to fulfil a legal obligation to which we are subject (legal basis: Art. 6 (1) c) GDPR) or when it is necessary for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims (legal basis: Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR).</span></p><h4 id="f-Period-of-storage" data-id="f-Period-of-storage"><span>f)	Period of storage</span></h4><p><span>The time specified in the “period of storage” paragraph indicates how long we use the data for the relevant purposes in any given case. At the end of this period, the data will no longer be processed by us but will be erased at regular intervals, unless continued processing and storage are required by law (mainly because it is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims) or unless you grant us extended consent.</span></p><h4 id="g-Data-categories" data-id="g-Data-categories"><span>g)	Data categories</span></h4><p><span>The category names listed below are used for specific types of data in the following sections:</span></p><ul>

</ul><h3 id="2-Accessing-our-services" data-id="2-Accessing-our-services"><span>2. Accessing our services</span></h3><p><span>The passages below set out how your personal data are processed when you access our services (e.g., loading and viewing the website, opening the mobile app and navigating within the app). We would point out that it is impossible not to send access data to external content providers (cf. subsection b) due to the technical processes involved in transmitting information over the Internet. The third-party providers are themselves responsible for the privacy-compliant operation of the IT systems which they use. The service providers are required to decide how long the data will be stored.</span></p><h4 id="a-Purposes-of-data-processing-legal-basis-legitimate-interests-where-applicable-and-period-of-storage" data-id="a-Purposes-of-data-processing-legal-basis-legitimate-interests-where-applicable-and-period-of-storage"><span>a)	Purposes of data processing, legal basis, legitimate interests (where applicable), and period of storage</span></h4><ul>
