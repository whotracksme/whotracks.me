    <h2>Scope of validity</h2>

    This data privacy statement informs users of the nature, scope and purpose of the
    collection and use of personal data on this website by Ghostery GmbH
    (hereinafter: the “Provider”).

    The provisions of the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the German
    Telemedia Act (TMG) form the legal basis for data privacy. Our Data Protection Officer
    is:
    <br />
    <br />

    Konzerndatenschutzbeauftragter Hubert Burda Media Holding KG<br />

    <h2>Information gathered by the WhoTracks.Me website</h2>

    We log requests to our website via
    <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html">
      CloudFront's logging mechanism</a>. These logs, which contain visitors' IP
    addresses, are anonymised daily with a process which encrypts this IP with a
    key that is subsequently destroyed. After this step, the original IP addresses
    can not longer be recovered. The original CloudFront logs are deleted
    after 24 hours.

    In summary, access logs containing IP addresses are kept for 24 hours.
    Anonymised logs which are held longer have no identifiers, and cannot be
    linked to the requestor IP address.

    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    WhoTracks.Me stands for a safer, more transparent web where privacy is a human right.
    As such, we do not use cookies and do not include any third party services except the
    content delivery network <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon Cloudfront</a>
    that serves the site, which is already configured to maximum privacy settings,
    bound by a legal contract.
