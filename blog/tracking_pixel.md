A tracking pixel, is one of various techniques used on web pages or email, to unobtrusively (usually invisibly) allow checking that a user has accessed some content. Common uses are email tracking and page tagging for web analytics. Alternative names are `web beacon`, `web bug`, `tracking bug`, `tag`, or `page tag`, `pixel tag`, `1×1 gif`, and `clear gif`. When implemented using JavaScript, they may be called JavaScript tags [[1](https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Marketing/web_bug.html)]

There is a work in progress to standardize an interface that web developers can use to asynchronously transfer small HTTP data from the User Agent to a web server that call it simply beacons (in the context of web development) which can be used to send data to a web server prior to the loading of the document without delaying the load and affecting the perception of page load performance for the next navigation [[2](http://www.w3.org/TR/beacon/)].
