A tracker is a company which collects information about you as you browse the web. Their scripts and [tracking pixels](/blog/tracking_pixel.html) are inserted into the websites you visit by publishers or advertising networks, usually in exchange for some service that the tracking company provides.

What is tracker profiling?
===

Trackers use identifier tools to link information about you from different sites. This data is used to build up a user profile, based on your browsing history.

Tracker profiling places users in groups and sells data to third parties so they can target certain users online.

Trackers profiling you meaning
---

We define a tracker as a third-party domain which is:

- present on multiple (`> 10`) different websites with a significant combined traffic
- uses [cookies](/blog/cookies.html) or [fingerprinting](/blog/fingerprinting.html) methods in order to transmit user identifiers


Why do trackers exist?
===

The majority of the companies behind trackers offer services to website publishers. The publishers will put scripts or [tracking pixels](/blog/tracking_pixel.html) for these services onto their sites.

What are trackers used for?
===

There are many different use-cases for these services, such as:

- There are many different use cases for these services, such as:
- Analytics: Used to measure how many people are visiting the site, where from, etc. e.g. Google Analytics.
- Advertising: Provides advertising on sites in order to monetise visits. e.g. DoubleClick and Outbrain.
- Advertising (conversion tracking): Advertising trackers can also appear on sites without ads. This is usually to measure conversions or to improve the targeting of the publisher’s ads elsewhere on the web.
- Social Media: Integration with social networks. e.g. Facebook like button.
- Content Delivery Networks (CDN): Networks which provide high bandwidth content like videos and images. e.g. Youtube and Cloudflare.
- Comments: Embedded comment systems allow users to comment on articles. e.g. Disqus.
- Customer interaction: Live chat and support widgets. e.g. LivePerson.

Many of these use cases do not require tracking. However, they may track your behavior by accident because the implementation is easier, or on purpose because the data generated can be used to increase revenue.

What's the problem with tracking?
===

Trackers use user identifiers to group data received from each unique user, and browsers send the URL of the first-party page to third-party resources in the page [as standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer).

This means trackers are effectively able to collect a subset of users' browsing history. Even if this history is linked to an 'anonymous' identifier, any browsing history of reasonable length can be [deanonymised](http://randomwalker.info/publications/browsing-history-deanonymization.pdf) to [find the user](https://www.slideshare.net/jmpujol/data-collection-without-privacy-sideeffects-at-big2016-www-2016#20) behind it.

Ghostery is creating greater transparency around internet tracking
---

In the majority of cases, trackers are invisible on the pages they appear. This means there is little or no transparency about who is logging activity on a site, hence the need for privacy tools such as [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/) to call them out.
