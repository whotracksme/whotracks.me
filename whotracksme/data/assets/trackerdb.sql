This format was designed to serve ads and helps discover new really interesting for this visitor content. Also this format is allowing to use media banners and native ads in the same campaign, that is very useful for clients and agencies running brand promotion campaigns. The “serve interesting ads and content” idea is pretty much obvious, but the technical solution is complicated. It took Adnow team over 1 year to develop the first platform prototype. The effectiveness of it''s algorithms was pretty impressive from the very first steps. It became possible because in the early days our co-founders have been working with RTB, Big Data, media buying, pay per click campaigns and mobile advertising for the last 10-14 years. A combination of passion and experience made possible to improve this platform and just in 2 years make it the sharpest native ads tool.\r\nIn December 2015 Adnow started working with webmasters and publisher’s platform was opened for everyone. Since that time, getting more feedback from clients and our partners the algorithms and mathematical model were changed over 12 times improving the selective mechanics.\r\n2 years past and in 2016 Adnow is proud to be a platform for over 150 000 partners, serving over 4 billion impressions each month throughout 107 countries. We are really happy with these results, but there is a long way ahead to perfection and we know it. We are working hard every day on improving our products and algorithms to provide highest incomes for both sides – advertisers and publishers.

INSERT INTO "companies" VALUES('campus_explorer','Campus Explorer','The philosophy at Campus Explorer is pretty simple: We believe everyone deserves a fulfilling education, no matter the name or place. We think that given the proper tools, anyone shopping for college or continuing education can find the perfect fit.\r\n\r\nCampusExplorer.com is the place to begin that great adventure. We have compiled everything you need for a college search, right here in one site.\r\n\r\nWhether it''s a two- or four-year school, a career college or an online program, we have figured out everything from tuition to average temperature. We also have a personalized search function that allows you to set your wish list and explore from there. We even have direct partnerships with schools to put you in touch with admissions officers.\r\n\r\nOur database today contains information on more than 8,000 schools, and counting. It''s accurate. It''s easy to use. It''s the most comprehensive directory devoted to higher education you''ll find anywhere on the web. And it''s free!\r\n\r\nWhy did we build CampusExplorer.com?\r\n\r\nAs far as life decisions go, college is a big one. It can determine your career path, your friends, your future.\r\n\r\nWe think it''s the kind of decision you want to get right the first time around. But we know that for many students, that''s easier said than done.\r\n\r\nStudent-to-counselor ratios are out-of-whack in public school systems around the country. California, for instance, has one college counselor for every 600 students, on average. Elsewhere, you''ll hear 1:250 cited as a common counselor-to-student ratio.\r\n\r\nValuable and informed college counseling is impossible to come by in those conditions. And even if you''re one of the most resourceful kids at school, you''ve probably already figured out there aren''t many free places to look for good, first-hand and objective information on higher-ed opportunities.\r\n\r\nIf you''re an adult looking for options to continue your education, you''ve faced the very same problem.\r\n\r\nIt''s hardly surprising, then, that transfer rates at colleges are mounting steadily. According to the US Department of Education, as many as 60% of American college students now attend more than one school before graduating. Experts say the reasons are clear: general dissatisfaction with a school; cost; changing majors; even homesickness.\r\n\r\nAlso evident is the fact that transfers cost us minutes and money, not to mention stress, during a time in our lives that''s supposed to be peaceful and positive.\r\n\r\nWe think it''s interesting that the transfer rate had been climbing consistently for almost two decades, but just recently skyrocketed – right in the midst of the Information Age. Perhaps that has something to do with the fact that even though there''s more information available to us than ever before, sifting through every last byte that comes across our screens can be a major challenge.\r\n\r\nAt Campus Explorer we''ve done the heavy lifting for you. We''ve sourced the primary providers of information – the government, the schools themselves, and their students – and made it easy for you to find what is most valuable and relevant.\r\n\r\nThe choice is yours; we just put everything into one place for you.\r\n\r\nHow do you get started?\r\n\r\nStudents: Whether you are just graduating high school, looking for graduate schools, wanting to change careers, getting certified in your trade or looking for a fun night class, Campus Explorer is here to help. We let you search for schools by major or field of study, location, degree type and much more. If you already have a wish list of schools in mind, search by name and dig right into the campus profiles. Watch videos. Cruise through school photos. Calculate your chance of admission. We can also help you compare price tags and track applications. We''re here 24/7. Think of us as your personal college counselor.\r\n\r\nGuidance Counselors: Your students are all very different. You want the best for all of them. At the same time, there are only so many minutes in a school-day. You need one-stop shopping when it comes to college research. We''ll help you search through vast quantities of information across thousands of schools. You''ll be able to home in quickly on an array of options for a diverse student body and help each student complete his or her plan for the future.\r\n\r\nAdmissions Officers: You want to give an in-depth and rounded view of your school to students across the country, especially to potential applicants in other regions who may be unfamiliar with your program. You may also want to give interested students an easy way to contact you. Use our campus profile pages and our many interactive tools to showcase your school to both students and guidance counselors.\r\n\r\nCampus Explorer: Find your future.','http://www.campusexplorer.com/company/legal/privacy/','http://www.campusexplorer.com/','4094',NULL,'privacy@campusexplorer.com','2/27/17 JW:  Opt Out is not for campus explorer.

As the development team behind the first Ad exchange, RightMedia, we have evolved with the industry from its outset.\r\nFrom 2004 to 2007, IPONWEB built most components of the Right Media platform at least once. Some components had up to 3 complete redesign and builds by different teams. In 2007, Yahoo acquired Right Media, and began to phase out IPONWEB’s involvement. IPONWEB finished working on the Right Media platform in 2009.\r\nSince then, we have now contributed to, in part or in entirety, the build and operation of dozens of similar scale projects, and several dozen smaller, but just as algorithmically complex platforms. In total, we have built more than 120 different flavours of trading systems (DSP’s, SSP’s, Exchanges, DMP’s and other acronyms) for many of the biggest names in the industry.\r\n80% of our senior team has been with us since those early days, an almost unprecedented achievement in today’s high turnover and competitive Internet environment. We believe we are one of the few companies in the world that have the exposure to the type of engineering challenges that building and operating these platforms represents, not once, not twice, but tens of dozens of times. We know of no other company that can boast of this depth of experience and knowledge in this space.\r\nEach IPONWEB solution is unique and proprietary for every customer; but we leverage the collective experience to evolve products & platforms at an unmatched level of scale & sophistication. We have developed a unique methodology, based around our u-Platform technology stack, that delivers a fast, flexible, innovative and definitive solution for platform development in the online media space.\r\nThis combined with our extensive background in algorithmic refinement and probability modeling gets our customers to market quickly, at high quality, with minimal engineering risk. We save our customers the years of development time, investment, mistakes & learning required to simply gain competitive parity.\r\nImportantly though this is just the start of the journey. With IPONWEB as a partner, our customers are able to focus their resources on what really matters, iterating their business and commercial model.

The Lytics CDP connects a company''s marketing data about customers and users from multiple sources (e.g., structured and unstructured data from tools, anonymous and known profiles, and other interactions and events from the marketing stack, sales, and support databases) and creates behavior-rich user segments (e.g., likely to churn, most active on mobile, coupon lover). These customer segments then sync with a company''s marketing tools (from web-site personalization and ad retargeting, to email marketing and content optimization) to improve marketing campaign results and reduce inefficiencies.\r\n\r\nMany marketing technology vendors claim \"customer data management,\" yet deal with only one or two types of data (such as customers who''ve signed in via a social media tool or provided an email address). Lytics builds a profile based on unifying any fragment of customer information using sophisticated data science and conducts probabilistic matching to merge identities. The result: a golden record of reference for each consumer.\r\n\r\nLytics is led by marketing-technology veterans who’ve held leadership positions at Webtrends, Urban Airship, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

Its platform & products are licensed by various publishers, ad networks, and other ad tech companies worldwide. Each product implementation has the feature set required to execute successfully. Media.net builds products that auto-learn and optimize to display the most relevant ads and offers to end-users in formats that provide a balance of user experience and revenue, and provide industry leading user privacy protections. This creates long-term sustainable value and, at the same time, maximizes publisher revenue and provides high ROI to advertisers. It simplifies online advertising by building top-tier products across multiple segments within ad tech such that all of the customers’ needs are met without them having to engage multiple vendors, or at their option, to use the Company’s platform to unify the solutions from multiple vendors that they want to manage. Media.net’s offerings incorporate proprietary machine learning algorithms, sophisticated data processing, and detailed analytics capabilities to successfully target internet users. It currently manages traffic that generates 70+ million paid ad clicks each month (as at Q1 2016). To put this into perspective, at the industry average display CTR of 0.08%, it wouldrequire others an estimated 87.5+ billion display ad impressions permonth to generate this volume of ad clicks.\r\nMedia.net’s suite is constantly self-optimizing based on its ability to analyze and learn from vast volumes of data. Additional data obtained from the volume of transactions on the platform make its algorithms more intelligent, leading to higher quality matching, stronger ROI for advertisers, and increased revenue for publishers. As a result of this high quality matching, Media.net attracts even more sellers, which in turn attracts more buyers, leading to strong network effects. Further, Media.net is the original creator of the display-to-search (D2S) ad format, a highly sophisticated method of monetizing display placements by identifying user search intent and displaying relevant search keywords which lead to display of search ads bought by advertisers on a cost per click (CPC) pricing model. Advertisers have seen extremely high conversion/sales through this format without the risk of having to buy cost per thousand impressions (CPM) based media where they run the risk of paying for media with which users did not engage. Hence, this format enjoys uncapped advertising budgets as it is seen by advertisers as a cost of sales rather than an operating expense from a discretionary marketing budget. Media.net’s robust technology platform, extensive product features, rigorous quality and compliance standards, and experience in quickly ramping to achieve scale represent meaningful and lasting competitive advantages that have generated powerful results for Media.net’s publisher and advertiser clients.\"\r\n','https://www.media.net/en/privacy-policy','http://www.media.net/','1879',NULL,'privacy@media.net','8/29/13 DB: Added indirect OO.

This algorithmic innovation around video then helped Taboola broaden its solution to recommend articles and slideshows, providing world-leading publishers with a single, ultimate discovery and monetization solution. \r\nThese days, passionate about connecting people around-the-world with content they may like, there are over 400 of us \"Taboolars\" drilling out recommendations between NY, Pasadena, London, Israel, India and Bangkok.
