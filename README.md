-----

This repository contains:

  - data on trackers and websites as shown on [whotracks.me](https://whotracks.me/) (WTM)
  - database mapping tracker domains to companies
  - code to render the [whotracks.me](https://whotracks.me/) site

# Installation

Python 3.6 is needed to build the site. We recommend creating a
[virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) (or `pipenv`) to install the dependencies.

## With Pip

``` sh
$ pip install git+https://github.com/ghostery/whotracks.me.git
```

## From source

After cloning the repository (requires `git-lfs`):

``` sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install -e .
```

That’s all you need to get started\!

# Using the data

To get started with the data, everything you need can be found in
`whotracksme.data`:

``` python
from whotracksme.data.loader import DataSource

data = DataSource()

# available entities
data.trackers
data.companies
data.sites
```

A whitepaper for whotracks.me is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08959, and here's a BibTeX entry that you can use to cite it in a publication:

```
@misc{whotracksme,
    title={WhoTracks.Me: Shedding light on the opaque world of online tracking},
    author={Arjaldo Karaj and Sam Macbeth and Rémi Berson and Josep M. Pujol},
    year={2018},
    eprint={1804.08959},
    archivePrefix={arXiv},
    primaryClass={cs.CY}
}
```


# Building the site

Building the site requires a few extra dependencies, not installed by
default to not make the installation heavier than it needs to be. You
will need to install `whotracksme` from the repository, because not all
assets are packaged with `whotracksme` released on pypi:

``` sh
$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
$ pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

Once this is done, you will have access to a `whotracksme` entry point
that can be used this way:

``` sh
$ whotracksme website [serve]
```

The `serve` part is optional and can be used while making changes on the
website.

All generated artifacts can be found in the `_site/` folder.

## Tests

To run tests, you will need `pytest`, or simply install `whotacksme`
with the `dev` extra:

``` sh
$ pip install -e '.[dev]'
$ pytest
```

# Contributing
